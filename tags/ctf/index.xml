      <title>SROP Exploitation with radare2</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered a paper that demonstrates a fancy ROP-style exploitation technique for Linux based systems. It&amp;rsquo;s called Sigreturn-oriented programming (SROP) and was released by two dudes of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2014. This post contains background information on this exploitation technique and shows how to pull it off using radare2 and pwntools.
Sigreturn-Oriented Programming The cool thing about this technique is that only one or two gadgets are required in order to get control over all registers of the target process.</description>

      <title>MemLabs: An Introduction To Memory Forensics</title>

      <description>Since you&amp;rsquo;re all isolated, grumpy and bored I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to create a little introduction to memory forensics. The test subject is the first stage of MemLabs, a set of CTF challenges focused on memory forensics by @_abhiramkumar. Each stage has its own memory dump that was taken from a live system using a tool like DumpIt. The goal for the first stage of MemLabs is to obtain all three flags.</description>

      <title>Exploiting A Use-After-Free With radare2 - CTF Challenge</title>
      <link>https://bananamafia.dev/post/uaf-1/</link>

      <description>This writeup is about a 36C3 junior CTF challenge called minifd which can be found here. The goal is to find and exploit a user-after-free vulnerability in order to spawn a shell on the remote system. Here&amp;rsquo;s the challenge description:
This is a simple file manager implementation supporting basic functionality to create, read, and write files.
Please note: This is a prototype implementation. At this point of time, only 16 files can be managed at the same time.</description>

      <description>1337 skills Task description:
It’s too hard to gain all 1337 h4x0r skills required by nowadays CTFs ._.! I am glad a friendly hacker told me about an App he got during a (growth) hacking course. Sadly, he didn’t wrote down any activations codes.
Ready for your hacking exam?
As can be read above, an Android app was given at the beginning of the challenge, with the hint to get a valid activation code for it.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Instrumentation: Frida And r2frida For Noobs</title>
      <link>https://bananamafia.dev/post/r2frida-1/</link>

      <guid>https://bananamafia.dev/post/r2frida-1/</guid>
      <description>One of my main takeaways from this year&amp;rsquo;s r2con is that Frida is cool and that r2frida, the integration with radare2, is even cooler. Using this, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to pair the benefits of dynamic instrumentation of Frida with the analysis features and workflow of radare2. This is a small tutorial to get started with both Frida and r2frida that&amp;rsquo;s based on the r2xor challenge of the recent r2con CTF. Please note that this is not a complete writeup for r2xor.</description>

      <description>r2boy1 The first GameBoy challenge was rather easy. The idea was to talk to the Pancake character in-game in order to get the flag. The problem is that Pancake chills behind a wall. One possible solution was to glitch through the wall, however I&amp;rsquo;ve solved this using static analysis.
Going through the strings and searching for a possible dialog yields interesting strings:
[0x00054075]&amp;gt; izzq~pancake 0x54016 37 36 Find pancake\nthrough a game\nglitch!</description>

      <title>ROP On x64: What&#39;s ret2csu Again?</title>

      <description>Based on the Stop, ROP, n&amp;rsquo;, Roll challenge from this year&amp;rsquo;s Redpwn CTF, this post will explain how to make system calls on x64 using ROP in order to spawn a shell. Also, it shows how to abuse writable memory regions of a process to overcome difficulties with some ROP gadgets. And the best thing is, two of the gadgets used in this writeup are universal and most likely also present in your x64 target if it&amp;rsquo;s using glibc.</description>

      <title>Reversing .NET Applications: CCCamp19 CTF CampRE Challenge</title>

      <description>Finally a nice .NET CTF challenge - time to pull out dnSpy :)
The provided ZIP includes a CampRE.dll file which, according to the challenge description, is a .NET Core application. Time to boot a Windows VM and install the .NET Core runtime environment.
After decompiling the dll, this source code can be inspected:
private static void Main(string[] args) { byte[] sourceArray = File.ReadAllBytes(Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof(Program)).Location); for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1333337; i++) { MD5 md = MD5.</description>

      <title>Exploiting PHP Deserialization: CCCamp19 CTF PDFCreator Challenge</title>

      <description>Deserialization is a vulnerability class that&amp;rsquo;s often overlooked. It&amp;rsquo;s great that this year&amp;rsquo;s CCCamp CTF included an interesting web based challenge that is based on this vulnerability class.
The Target The challenge includes a link to a web service that allows converting user-supplied images into PDF files. Users can upload image files, add some additional HTML content in a textbox and render the whole thing into a PDF file:
A ZIP file with the source code of the web application is also available.</description>

      <title>CryptoCTF 2019 Writeup: Decode Me</title>

      <description>This is short writeup on the Decode Me challenge of the first CryptoCTF.
The following string has to be decoded into a flag somehow:
D: mb xwhvxw mlnX 4X6AhPLAR4eupSRJ6FLt8AgE6JsLdBRxq57L8IeMyBRHp6IGsmgFIB5E :ztey xam lb lbaH The first thing that comes to mind is that some sort of substitution cipher was being used in the first place. A cipher of this kind is the Caesar cipher which is also known as ROT. Fiddling around with this cipher and a key of 7 yields:</description>

      <title>Brute-Forcing x86 Stack Canaries</title>
      <link>https://bananamafia.dev/post/binary-canary-bruteforce/</link>

      <description>And now for something more CTF-y: Dealing with stack canaries by brute-forcing their value byte by byte.
How Stack Canaries Work If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever read the error message *** stack smashing detected ***: &amp;lt;...&amp;gt; terminated, you&amp;rsquo;ve already encountered stack canaries in action. They are being used to detect and stop buffer overflows by placing a per-process randomized value between the local variables and the saved return address. If an attacker somehow manages to write across the boundary of a buffer in order to overwrite the saved return address, he will also overwrite the canary.</description>
