      <description>This post covers creating a hack for the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The hack I&amp;rsquo;ve developed works in combination with the Linux version of the game - coding a windows-based hack can however be done with the same methodology and tools.
These are the features I&amp;rsquo;ve integrated into the hack:
 Bunnyhop Bot: Do jumps as soon as the player hits the ground to make it easier to perform bunny hop chains No Flash: Be immune to flash grenades that would block the players vision Aimbot: Automatically aim at the head of the nearest enemy  Tooling &amp;amp; Setup Linux lacks of good tools to perform the kind of analysis tasks required to code a cheat like this.</description>

Sometimes people just simply refer to this engine as the Quake3 engine. This post teaches you how to create hacks for games that are based on this game engine. The target of choice is the game Jedi Academy, which was released in 2003. Oldschool, I know - but most of the injection and hooking techniques can also be applied to modern games.</description>
