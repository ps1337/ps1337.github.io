      <description>This is the second part of my posts about Dotfile management. Part one can be found here.
After spending a lot of time and effort on your Dotfiles, it may be useful to setup an automated deployment process. There are existing solutions like GNU Stow, but for maximum flexibility the use of Ansible may be a better option. Using this, files and advanced configuration hierarchies can be distributed easily. This post covers my personal setup, which also includes an automated deployment test approach for multiple linux distributions.</description>

The mentioned approach triggers a travis linting process after pushing to to the Dotfiles repository on GitHub. This post will explain all necessary steps to integrate this process into your own repository.</description>
