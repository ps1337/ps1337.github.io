      <description>This writeup is about a 36C3 junior CTF challenge called minifd which can be found here. The goal is to find and exploit a user-after-free vulnerability in order to spawn a shell on the remote system. Here&#39;s the challenge description:
This is a simple file manager implementation supporting basic functionality to create, read, and write files.

      <description>1337 skills Task description:
It’s too hard to gain all 1337 h4x0r skills required by nowadays CTFs ._.! I am glad a friendly hacker told me about an App he got during a (growth) hacking course. Sadly, he didn’t wrote down any activations codes.
Ready for your hacking exam?
 As can be read above, an Android app was given at the beginning of the challenge, with the hint to get a valid activation code for it.</description>
