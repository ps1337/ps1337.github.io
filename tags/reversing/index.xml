      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started a little fuzzing project. After doing some research, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to fuzz a gaming emulator. The target of choice is a GameBoy and GameBoy Advance emulator called VisualBoyAdvance-M, which is also called VBA-M. At the time of writing the emulator was still being maintained. VBA-M seems to be a fork of VisualBoyAdvance, for which development seems to have stopped in 2006.
Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m publishing this blog post to share some fuzzing methodology and tooling and not to blame the developers.</description>

      <description>This writeup is about a 36C3 junior CTF challenge called minifd which can be found here. The goal is to find and exploit a user-after-free vulnerability in order to spawn a shell on the remote system. Here&amp;rsquo;s the challenge description:
This is a simple file manager implementation supporting basic functionality to create, read, and write files.
Please note: This is a prototype implementation. At this point of time, only 16 files can be managed at the same time.</description>

      <description>1337 skills Task description:
It’s too hard to gain all 1337 h4x0r skills required by nowadays CTFs ._.! I am glad a friendly hacker told me about an App he got during a (growth) hacking course. Sadly, he didn’t wrote down any activations codes.
Ready for your hacking exam?
As can be read above, an Android app was given at the beginning of the challenge, with the hint to get a valid activation code for it.</description>
