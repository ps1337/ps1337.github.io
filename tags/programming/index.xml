      <title>Reinschauer: Remotely Controlling Windows Machines</title>

      <description>Recently, I did some research on Hidden VNCs (HVNC). This is a neat feature for attackers to have, since it allows to remotely control a compromised system on a new and separate virtual desktop that is not visible to the victim. This way, it is possible to remotely launch and use GUI programs without generating any visual indicators for victims.
Implementing HVNC is complicated. First of all, you need to be able to grab the screen contents of the hidden desktop.</description>

      <description>A while ago, I&amp;rsquo;ve found an article on Hackaday, describing how to stream arbitrary YouTube videos to Sonos systems. Before you ask: No, that&amp;rsquo;s not possible normally, at least not without a premium subscription.
In the original article called How I hacked SONOS and YouTube the same day (lol?????), the author described an approach to grab audio streams from YouTube and to convert them into ADTS streams on-the-fly to convince a Sonos device to play some YouTube music.</description>

      <title>Easy Remote Pair Programming Using Docker and Tmux</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve created a small docker container to perform remote pair programming. Shared shell sessions are an easy way to remotely interact with coworkers or other people. With additional docker magic you now don&amp;rsquo;t even have to give them access to your host system - they will be contained just like you and the work that&amp;rsquo;s being done. Using my docker image, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to share a tmux session with a group of people.</description>
