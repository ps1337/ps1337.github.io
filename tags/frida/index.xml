      <description>In a previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered Frida and its instrumentation abilities. But check this out: You can also use Frida to perform fuzzing. What&amp;rsquo;s even greater is that Frida allows in-process fuzzing.
Why would you want to do this? There may be various reasons, but the most outstanding one for me is building a fuzzing harness for closed source applications and libraries. Just take Counter Strike GO as an example:</description>

      <title>Dynamic Instrumentation: Frida And r2frida For Noobs</title>

      <description>One of my main takeaways from this year&amp;rsquo;s r2con is that Frida is cool and that r2frida, the integration with radare2, is even cooler. Using this, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to pair the benefits of dynamic instrumentation of Frida with the analysis features and workflow of radare2. This is a small tutorial to get started with both Frida and r2frida that&amp;rsquo;s based on the r2xor challenge of the recent r2con CTF. Please note that this is not a complete writeup for r2xor.</description>
