      <title>Dynamic Instrumentation: Frida And r2frida For Noobs</title>
      <link>https://bananamafia.dev/post/r2frida-1/</link>

      <guid>https://bananamafia.dev/post/r2frida-1/</guid>
      <description>One of my main takeaways from this year&amp;rsquo;s r2con is that Frida is cool and that r2frida, the integration with radare2, is even cooler. Using this, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to pair the benefits of dynamic instrumentation of Frida with the analysis features and workflow of radare2. This is a small tutorial to get started with both Frida and r2frida that&amp;rsquo;s based on the r2xor challenge of the recent r2con CTF. Please note that this is not a complete writeup for r2xor.</description>

      <description>r2boy1 The first GameBoy challenge was rather easy. The idea was to talk to the Pancake character in-game in order to get the flag. The problem is that Pancake chills behind a wall. One possible solution was to glitch through the wall, however I&amp;rsquo;ve solved this using static analysis.
Going through the strings and searching for a possible dialog yields interesting strings:
[0x00054075]&amp;gt; izzq~pancake 0x54016 37 36 Find pancake\nthrough a game\nglitch!</description>

      <description>Finally a nice .NET CTF challenge - time to pull out dnSpy :)
The provided ZIP includes a CampRE.dll file which, according to the challenge description, is a .NET Core application. Time to boot a Windows VM and install the .NET Core runtime environment.
After decompiling the dll, this source code can be inspected:
private static void Main(string[] args) { byte[] sourceArray = File.ReadAllBytes(Assembly.GetAssembly(typeof(Program)).Location); for (int i = 0; i &amp;lt; 1333337; i++) { MD5 md = MD5.</description>

      <title>ROP It Like It&#39;s Hot: ROP Basics - Stack Pivoting</title>
      <link>https://bananamafia.dev/post/binary-rop-stackpivot/</link>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s check out Return Oriented Programming (ROP) with the pivot32 challenge from ROP Emporium by using radare2. The pivot32 binary is compiled without stack canaries and PIE but has NX enabled.
Basics The general principle behind ROP is that:
[&amp;hellip;] an attacker gains control of the call stack to hijack program control flow and then executes carefully chosen machine instruction sequences that are already present in the machine&amp;rsquo;s memory, called &amp;ldquo;gadgets&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>r2con 2019 PwnDebian Challenge: Exploiting radare2 (CVE-2019-14745)</title>

      <description>Hello hello!
Everyone knows: This years r2con, the conference about radare2, has a very special challenge &amp;ndash; PwnDebian:
The almighty blenk92 and me decided to assist the radare2 project in finding such an exploit an we think we were quite successful :)
But first some basics for r2.
Shelling Out Via The r2 Shell While running r2, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to shell out and execute shell commands without leaving the r2 console:</description>

      <title>Coding A CS:GO Hack</title>

      <description>This post covers creating a multihack for the game Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The created hack works with the Linux version of the game - coding a windows-based hack can however be done with the same methodology and tools. Below you can find a demonstration of the finished cheat:
The features therefore include:
 Bunnyhop Bot: Do jumps as soon as the player hits the ground to make it easier to perform bunny hop chains No Flash: Be immune to flash grenades that would block the players vision Aimbot: Automatically aim at the head of the nearest enemy  Tooling &amp;amp; Setup Linux lacks of good tools to perform the kind of analysis tasks required to code a cheat like this.</description>

      <title>Bypassing ASLR and DEP for 32-Bit Binaries With r2</title>
      <link>https://bananamafia.dev/post/binary-aslr-dep-32/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bananamafia.dev/post/binary-aslr-dep-32/</guid>
      <description>This post covers basic basics of bypassing ASLR and DEP with r2. For this, a vulnerable application, yolo.c, is required:
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt; void lol(char *b) { char buffer[1337]; strcpy(buffer, b); } int main(int argc, char **argv) { lol(argv[1]); }  64-Bit vs 32-Bit Binaries The issue here should be quite obvious - strcpy blindly copies the user-controlled input buffer b into buffer which causes a buffer overflow.</description>

      <title>Random Note #092345: Passing binary input via GDB</title>
      <link>https://bananamafia.dev/post/rnd-092345-gdb/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://bananamafia.dev/post/rnd-092345-gdb/</guid>
      <description>When trying to exploit an application it&amp;rsquo;s useful to send the input via gdb to immediately check how the input is being processed. But once the gdb is open it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes not clear how to pass binary input to applications reading from stdin, e.g. using read. An easy way is to start the debugging session with gdb ./binary and using
run &amp;lt; &amp;lt;(printf &amp;quot;\xAA\xAA\xAA&amp;quot;)  from the gdb session to send arbitrary bytes.</description>

      <description>Ever wondered about the various techniques that can be applied to hack modern cars? This post documents various ways to do so - you can use it as a cheatsheet
Software There are multiple ways one can interface with the software stack of a car. The easiest one is to use USB-to-Ethernet adapters in order to attach to the network of the car. It&amp;rsquo;s important to use special adapters that are whitelisted on the car&amp;rsquo;s head unit.</description>

      <title>Creating A Multiplayer Game Hack</title>

      <description>What? This post covers creating a multihack for multiplayer games. The target is a Quake3 based game called Jedi Academy. I&amp;rsquo;ve found the techniques and process of doing this to be fairly undocumented and obscure, so this can serve as a starting point for researchers and game hackers.
I&amp;rsquo;ve released my multihack source code. These are the implemented features:
 Wallhack (seeing enemies through walls) Player Glow (Enemies are glowing) Cheat Unlocker (Use otherwise blocked client side settings) Triggerbot (Automatically pull the trigger and shoot at enemies once they are in the crosshair)  This is what the wallhack and player glow looks like:</description>

      <title>Runtime Function Patching</title>
      <link>https://bananamafia.dev/post/cvar-hax/</link>

      <description>When it comes to patching certain functions of a binary on ASM level, it&amp;rsquo;s often performed by modifying the binary itself. This post shows a different approach to accomplish the same thing: Removing game cheat protections using runtime function patching.
The Target This is being shown in the following context: Quake3 based multiplayer games include certain settings (CVars) which are disabled for players to prevent cheating. These settings would enable clients to disable fog and shadows and use different camera angles.</description>

      <description>tl;dr Generating licenses using MD5(email) is bad.
Validating licenses using HTTP in plain text is bad.
The Software This post covers reverse engineering and cracking the license validation process of a popular and closed source self hosted music server application. The developer has been notified about the findings, however no reply has been received. The validation issues still exist as of now and affects all issued licenses. Because of this, the name of the application won&amp;rsquo;t be disclosed.</description>
