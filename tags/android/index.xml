These parameters are stored in the class OralBApplication and also get used there:

      <description>NQ Contacts Backup &amp;amp; Restore is an android app that allows users to backup and restore contact data (as vcard) to/from the remote NQ server. For the audit, the android app was the primary target.
Note: The app shares its code base with NQ Mobile Security &amp;amp; Anti Virus - hence the odd class names for a simple contact backup app.
CVE-2017-15999: Lack of HTTPS usage When logging in or transmitting data, the app communicates with the remote server via HTTP.</description>
