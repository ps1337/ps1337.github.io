      <title>Fuzzing A GameBoy Emulator With AFL&#43;&#43;</title>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started a little fuzzing project. After doing some research, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to fuzz a gaming emulator. The target of choice is a GameBoy and GameBoy Advance emulator called VisualBoyAdvance-M, which is also called VBA-M. At the time of writing the emulator was still being maintained. VBA-M seems to be a fork of VisualBoyAdvance, for which development seems to have stopped in 2006.
Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m publishing this blog post to share some fuzzing methodology and tooling and not to blame the developers.</description>

      <description>In a previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered Frida and its instrumentation abilities. But check this out: You can also use Frida to perform fuzzing. What&amp;rsquo;s even greater is that Frida allows in-process fuzzing.
Why would you want to do this? There may be various reasons, but the most outstanding one for me is building a fuzzing harness for closed source applications and libraries. Just take Counter Strike GO as an example:</description>
